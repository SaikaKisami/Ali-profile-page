                Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17,
                1942, was an American professional boxer and an activist.
              </h3>
              <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 400">
                Regarded as one of the most significant sports figures of the
                20th century and is frequently ranked as the greatest
                heavyweight boxer of all time, Ali was known for his
                trash-talking, often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken
                word poetry.
              </h3>
              <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 400">
                His iconic personality and outlandish persona made him one of
                the most recognisable figures in the world even outside of
                boxing.

                Ali was a two-time undisputed heavyweight world champion, first
                winning the title after defeating Liston in 1964. He held the
                title until 1967 when he was stripped of his titles due to his
                refusal to fight in the Vietnam War. Ali was also one of the few

            Foreman, Bob Foster, Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston, and Archie
            Moore), Henry Cooper, Leon Spinks, and Ernie Terrell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout his career, Ali had nicknames such as "The Greatest,"
            "The People's Champion," and "The Louisville Lip." His
            self-proclaimed "Greatest of All Time" nickname remains famous to
            this day. Ali was 6 feet 3 inches (191 cm) tall, with a reach of 78
            inches (198 cm), and fought in the orthodox stance. He competed in
            the heavyweight weight class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of boxing, Ali also attained success as a spoken word
            artist, releasing two studio albums: I Am the Greatest! (1963) and
            The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay (1976). Both
            albums received Grammy Award nominations. He also featured as an
            actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from
            boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy, and activism.

          <p>
            Reacting to his death in 2016, the then-President Barack Obama
            remarked that Ali was a "man who fought for what was right. A man
            who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it
            was hard; spoke out when others wouldn't. His fight outside the ring
            would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him
            enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send
            him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get
            used to the America we recognize today."
          </p>
          <p>
            Ali was a dexterous and evasive boxer with an impressive footwork
            who had an unusual combination of speed, agility, and power. He was
            famous for his "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" style of
            boxing. Ali's boxing skills gained him numerous accolades, including
            being named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the
